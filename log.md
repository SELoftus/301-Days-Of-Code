### Day 9: May 1, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished Dora for Day 5 and a working digital clock for Day 6 of #dailycssimages (http://codepen.io.ln.is/g0hZa ).

**Thoughts:** Dory will need to be revisited once I've got a little more skill under my belt. I think the 'perspective' command will help greatly.
